--SUMMARIZATIONS
--1. Based on what I pulled from the Labor Statistics Database, 
--production and nonsupervisory employees actually fared better 
--in January 2017 compared to 2016. 

--When I looked at the average weekly earnings for data_type_code 30 
--(which specifically tracks this group), the 2017 values were 
--consistently a much higher.

SELECT 
  '2016' AS year,
  AVG(annual_2016.value) AS avg_weekly_earnings
FROM LaborStatisticsDB.dbo.annual_2016 
JOIN LaborStatisticsDB.dbo.series 
  ON annual_2016.series_id = series.series_id

  AND series.series_title LIKE '%average weekly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees%'

  ON january_2017.series_id = series.series_id
WHERE january_2017.period = 'M01'
  AND series.data_type_code = '30'

--2. The Reinsurance carriers, Petroleum and coal products,
--Fossil fuel electric power generation, and Pipeline transportation
--were the top 5 industries to fair out better in terms of weekly earnings
--according to my query results.

SELECT TOP 5
    industry.industry_name,
    AVG(january_2017.value) AS avg_weekly_earnings
FROM LaborStatisticsDB.dbo.january_2017

--3. I wish the dataset included more recent years, 
--especially 2021 as originally referenced. It also wouldâ€™ve 
--helped to have data broken down by region or demographic so 
--we could analyze how different groups of production and
--nonsupervisory employees fared across the country.
